<h1>Wanna get in shape?</h1><br>
<section id="intro">Basically when you start working out, you have three main objectives: 1. <b>Eating healthy 2. Train regularly 3. Sleep enough.  </b>When you insist keeping these habits, then i can assure, that you will see results in a couple of month.<br>
This webpage is made to help with the beginning, so let's just take a little closer look at our main goals.</section><br>
<section id="eating"><b>Eating healthy is about 70% of getting in shape.</b> That would seem a lot, but its true. Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get the calories and nutrients you need to fuel your daily activities, including regular exercise. <figure><a href="photo1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photo1.jpg" alt="foods full of fibre" title="Healthy eating" width="720" height="250"></a></figure>
When it comes to eating foods to fuel your exercise performance, it’s not as simple as choosing vegetables over doughnuts. You need to eat the right types of food at the right times of the day.
Learn about the importance of healthy breakfasts, workout snacks, and meal plans on the <nav><a href="nutrition.html" target="_blank">nutrition</a></nav> page.</section><br>
<section id="workout">Next up is the <b>right exercises</b>, the right split of workouts and the right amount of training. After all, a workout should be developed around a person’s age, goals, nutritional strategy, free time, etc.<br>

Not only that, but it’s easy to overcomplicate this process – there are an infinite number of exercises, sets, reps, and programs to choose from. Different people may find different exercises effective and useful. However, there are exercises that are scientifically proven to be more effective, than others. We are going to discuss these exercises for each muscle group on the <nav><a href="exercises.html" target="_blank">exercises</a></nav> page. </section> <br>
<section id="supps">Our next topic is <b>workout supplements</b>.A popular category of dietary supplements are workout supplements, which are typically taken before (‘pre-workout’) or after exercising (‘post-workout’), and are sold in a variety of forms from pills to powders and ready-to-drink shakes. The global pre-workout supplement market size alone was estimated to reach $13.98 billion in 2020 and almost double in size to $23.77 billion by 2027.<figure><a href="photo3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photo3.jpg" alt="vitamins in supplements" title="supplements" height="200" width="350"></a></figure>
Fitness gurus and blogs touting these products as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, and explosive muscle growth in combination with complicated scientific-sounding names and labels might have you believing you can’t effectively exercise without them. But do these supplements live up to the hype, and are they even necessary—or in some cases, safe? 
We will talk about them on the <nav><a href="supplements.html" target="_blank">supplements</a></nav> page. </section> <br>
