    In this video the gentleman is showing us, how to dumbbel curls properly. He stands in front of us in a black T-shirt, with two dumbbels in his hands. Both arms gonna be working, not one at a time. It also works your forearms and wrists a bit. Feets shoulder width apart, knees are always loose. Elbows also loose, very important. Starting from neutral position come up, squeeez and controlled negative back to starting position. Always keep control, especially when doing the negative part, don't throw it around. Don't move your elbows, common mistake. Once again, nice and steady up, breathe in squeeze, and slowly down, breathe out.
