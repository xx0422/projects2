<h1 id="elso">Nutrition</h1><br>
<section id="intro">Pairing <b>carbs with protein</b> before workouts can help improve performance and recovery. Staying <b>hydrated</b> is also important and certain <b>supplements</b> like creatine or caffeine might be beneficial.
Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are always looking for ways to improve their performance and achieve their goals.
Good nutrition can help your body perform better and recover faster after each workout.
<b>Optimal nutrient intake</b> prior to exercise will not only help you maximize your performance but also minimize muscle damage</section><br>
<h2>Here is a brief look at how each macro nutrients affect your body:</h2><br>
<h3>Carbs</h3><br>
<article>Your muscles use the glucose from carbs for fuel.
Glycogen is the way the body processes and stores glucose, mainly in the liver and muscles.
For short and high intensity exercise, your glycogen stores are your muscles’ main source of energy .
But for longer exercises, the degree to which carbs are used depends on several factors. These include the <b>intensity, type of training, and your overall diet</b> .
Your muscles’ glycogen stores are limited. As these stores become depleted, your output and intensity diminish 
Studies have consistently shown that carbs can increase glycogen stores and utilization while boosting carb oxidation during exercise .
Carb loading, which involves consuming a high carb diet for 1–7 days, is a well-known method to maximize glycogen stores .</article><br>
<h3>Protein</h3><br>
<article>Many studies have documented the potential of pre-workout protein consumption to improve athletic performance.
Eating protein (alone or with carbs) prior to exercise has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis .
One small study found that consuming 25 grams (g) of whey protein before exercise enhanced whole body anabolism, or muscle growth, compared to a placebo (6Trusted Source).
<h4>Other benefits of eating protein before exercise include :</h4>
<ul>
    <li>increased muscle mass</li>
    <li>improved muscle recovery</li>
    <li>increased strength and lean body mass</li>
    <li>enhanced muscle performance</li>
</ul></article><br>
<h3>Fat</h3><br>
<article>While glycogen is used for short and high intensity bouts of exercise, fat is the source of fuel for <b>longer and moderate-to-low intensity</b> exercise .
Some studies have investigated the effects of fat intake on athletic performance. However, these studies looked at high fat diets over a long period, rather than prior to exercise .
For example, one review found that following a low carb, high fat diet could improve body composition and increase maximal oxygen uptake when paired with high intensity interval training (HIIT).<br>
<h2>Examples of preworkout meals:</h2><br>
<h3>In case you have a couple hours before training:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>sandwich on whole-grain bread, lean protein, and a side salad</li>
    <li>egg omelet and whole-grain toast topped with avocado spread and a cup of fruit</li>
    <li>lean protein, brown rice, and roasted vegetables</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>If your workout starts within 2 hours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>protein smoothie made with milk, protein powder, banana, and mixed berries</li>
    <li>whole-grain cereal and milk</li>
    <li>a cup of oatmeal topped with banana and sliced almonds</li>
    <li>natural almond butter and fruit preserve sandwich on whole-grain bread</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>If your workout starts within an hour or less</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Greek yogurt and fruit</li>
    <li>nutrition bar with protein</li>
    <li>a piece of fruit, such as a banana, orange, or apple</li>
</ul></article><br>
<section id="last">The point is that you <b>never go training with an empty stomach</b>, because, when your body needs energy, it has to burn something, that it can tkae energy from. Unfortunately the first thing its burns is not fat, but lean muscle. Morover, if you workout with an empty stomach, you will probably feel yourself weaker, and even dizzy after a few exercises.
Also, don’t forget to <b>hydrate</b>. It’s crucial not just for training, but on an everyday basis.
And as I see, those who are into meat, don’t have to worry. You wont be fat by eating meat. I mean, the meat, that you prepare and cook at home, not that you can buy at KFC. Meat is one of your best friends if you want to build muscle.
As I have already mentioned ont he Main page, these articles are rather just examples and recommendations. In case, you want to reach a higher level in muscle building, it is reasonable to consult with a professional trainer/diatetic.  </section>
